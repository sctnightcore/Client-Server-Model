Compile the server file and if the TCP socket is successfully initialized, then compile the client file.

The limitations are:

1, Only one to one connection. For mutiple clients, I need to learn about threading.

2, Only one message at a time, and the message needs to be ended with a chosen character for the other side to display the message.
