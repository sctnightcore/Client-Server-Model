A Client/Server model that communicate on two terminals in the linux enviroment.

**What is a socket?**<br />
A socket is the basic building block for communication.<br />
<br />
**What is a stream socket?**<br />
A bidirectional flow of data that when two of this sockets connected, it provides an interface.<br />
<br />
**How dose this program work?**<br />
The first step is to create a stream socket.<br />
client=socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM,0);<br />
Af_INEt: Internet domain.<br />
SOCK_STREAM: stream socket type.<br />
0: tells the system to select an appropriate protocol that made up the communication domain.<br />
<br />
Once the stream socket is created successful, it needs to be bounded with a name to process communication. <br />

bind(client, name, namelen)<br />
name: For this part, I just used what I found from google and place it here. Because this related to something called Network Address function, and I am not going to dig too deep into this at this stage. But I understand this is something about binding the internet address and port number with the socket<br />
<br />
After the socket is bounded, it will start to wait for incoming connections using the function listen(client,1). Where 1 is the maximum number of connections.<br />
<br />
When the server is listening for connection requests, the connect function in the clientâ€™s program connects to the server that has the same port number. Then the server will accept the connection using the function connect();<br />
<br />
what is next is to read and send messages to each other using the read() and write().<br />

# Note<br />
The limitations that I need to work on are:

1, Only one to one connection. For mutiple clients, I need to learn about threading.

2, Message has to be ended with a chosen chracter in order to break the while loop instead of after pressing the enter key. 

3, Only one message at a time after ending it.

Currently, I am working on 2 and 3. At the same time, I will also study threading.

Fixed the issue of binding the socket.the issue occured after closing the program and try to recompile it.<br />

cause:TCP sockets can have relatively long delay between adding data to the send buffer and having the TCP implementation really send that data.<br />
So, when the TCP socket is closed, the send buffer still has the pending data which is actually considered as sent. The socket then will go into a state call time_wait. In this state, the socket will wait untill all pending data has been successfully sent or until time out.<br />
In short, even though the socket is closed, the data is still pending. <br />

Solution: using SO_REUSEADDR solved the issue and which play an important role in the way of how sockets bind to the ports.
